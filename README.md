Permanently-Remote Service Reliability Engineer with a focus on the human side of engineering. 

<details><summary>Expand For Long-Form Bio</summary>
I have a strong background in service reliability (3 years) and professional web development (7 years), accented by a passion for creating things that help people. I started out creating web apps/websites for people and as time went on, realised I enjoyed the system architecture bit more and more. I graduated with a First Class Honours in Computer Science from University College Cork (UCC) in 2017, while managing a team that provided free services for students.

From 2015-2017, I transformed UCC's Networking Society (Netsoc) into a service provider for 230 server users, over 1000 non-technical students and half a dozen research academics. Through Netsoc I gained extensive operations and reliability experience (you learn twice as fast when your free services are on fire). As part of the society, I managed a team of 15 people and began my first adventure into the world of the DevOps/SRE philosophy.

After college, I got my first official SRE position with Hosted Graphite (a.k.a. Metricfire) which was an intense learning experience in a low-latency, high-stress product. I tell people that Hosted Graphite was 5 years of learning condensed into 2. While there, I enjoyed making tools that made peoples' lives easier. My work on the deployment pipeline specifically meant that we went from partial disruption to services with expected alerts to no downtime at all and removed the alert fatigue associated with deploys

Hosted Graphite was acquired in 2019 and I decided I wanted a new adventure. I moved to Berlin and became the sole SRE at Solvemate. Alongside a new Head of Engineering, I helped completely reformat the company's development processes, introduce structured incident response and implement DevOps throughout the company. A lot of my job at Solvemate is evangelising about SRE and introducing/teaching/workshopping new topics with engineers while also making changes like autoscaling to reduce our costs by 30%. Ultimately, I feel I have given Solvemate a solid foundation to build off in the future - not just in terms of infrastructure and process, but in terms of culture.

In the future, I'm interested in working more with people and pursuing the management track in engineering as I enjoy process and people problems. I believe a lot in the power of kindness when it comes to engineering and I am always looking for a chance to spread that somewhere new!
